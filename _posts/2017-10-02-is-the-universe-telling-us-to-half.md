The above quote beuatifully describes the equation. 

If we consider the above to be true on face value, we will be mugging up a formula, but not understand the inuitiveness of why infinite summations push us to think about deeper concepts in Mathematics. Another such case would be to go through the following example:

\\[ 3/3 = 1 \\]

Isnt it obviuos!

What about other fractions of \\( 3 \\)

\\[ 1/3 = 0.333... \\]
\\[ 2/3 = 0.666... \\]
\\[ 3/3 = 0.999... \\]

Wait! 

Does this mean \\( \frac{3}{3} \\) is not equal to \\( 1 \\) but equal to \\( 0.999... \\)

Both are correct. It is accepted that \\( 0.999... \\) is equal to \\( 1 \\), which can be also phrased as \\( 0.999... \\) approaches \\( 1 \\) at infinity.

We can prove this with some simple steps.


\\[ x = 0.999... \\]
\\[ 10x = 9.999... \\]
\\[ 10x = 9 + 0.999... \\]
\\[ 10x = 9 + x \\]
\\[ 9x = 9 \\]
\\[ x = 1 \\]
